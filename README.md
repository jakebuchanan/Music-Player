# Music-Player
This is a music player application I made in Vue.js using a tutorial. It is fairly simple as this is my first project using Javascript or Vue.js more specifically.
To use the music player you have to have yarn installed. 
To install yarn go to the terminal and input: yarn install
Once yarn is install go to the terminal and input: yarn serve
(This will allow the application to be on a server so you can access it in a web browser.)
Once that is done, go into the spotif folder, but don't close the terminal.
In the spotif folder, go to the public folder and click on the index file.
The five songs used are royalty-free.
The color palette was made using a color palette generator for design purposes.
